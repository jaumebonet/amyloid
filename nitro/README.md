## Mutation Analysis

Mutations were performed following the alignments defined in `alignments` with **MODELLER** as defined through the `script/simpleModel.py`.

4 different sequence variants were tested against 3 different conformations of the amyloid beta-peptide. Data for each one can be found in `models`.

To reduce storage, generated models were condensed into a **Rosetta silent file**.
